## Assignment 00

1. If you do not already have them, install:  
    * an editor: You are welcome to use whatever editor you would like.  There are many many options. See: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors  Lately, I have been using SublimeText and VSCode.
    * Python 3.8+, the NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib packages, and Jupyter notebooks on the computer(s) you will be bringing to class and using to complete your assignments. An easy way to install Python 3.8+ and all required packages is to install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/


2. If you do not have one, create a github account. Please select a username that is professional and clearly indicates who you are (e.g., my username is alinazare).   

3.  If you are not familiar with git, complete one (or a few) introductory tutorials:
    * Git bootcamp: https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/
    * Tutorials: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
    * Interactive Introduction: https://try.github.io/

4. Follow the assignment link for assignment repository.  After accepting the invitation, clone the repository to your local machine. 

5. Then, code up a python 3.8+ program that prints the following:

      My name is: [your name] <br>

      My machine learning experience is: [none/some/extensive]<br>
      I am excited to learn the following in this class: [complete with your response]<br>

6.  Starter code has been provided for you in your assignment repository.  You only need to edit, *verify that it runs properly*, and push back your submission. 

7.  Submit this through GitHub by pushing your completed code back to the github assignment repository.  

8.  Provide your github username on Canvas and ensure you can access the class notes.
